# Destiny-Drip-Rando
Have you ever wanted to have randomized looks on your Destiny Character? No? Just me then?

This is far from a complete program. I just wanted something to work, so I started messing about with Windows Forms a long while back. I've since come to appreciate WPF. Eventually™️ this will be a website where any Guardian can simply click a button and display the worst of drip as easy as pie!
